# Advanced Python for Remote Sensing\GIS

## Course Description
Have you ever wanted to learn how to publish, consume, and use geographic web services? Are in intrested in learning how typical desktop GIS and remote sensing workflows change when the data is shared as a web service? Do you want to learn how to create webmaps and webaps using Python, Javascript, and HTML? After completing this course, you will understand how to do all of these things! In **Advanced Python for GIS and Remote Sensing**, students will learn how to publish, consume, and analyze web services using Python. They will be introduced to more powerful, more advanced Python libraries such as [Pandas](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/03.00-introduction-to-pandas.html), [Numpy](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/02.00-introduction-to-numpy.html), [ArcGIS](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/), and [Folium](https://folium.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). They will also learn how to use the [ArcGIS API for Javascript](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/3/) to create their first stand-alone web applications. This class builds on what students learned in [GIS 4090\5090](https://github.com/gbrunner/Python_for_GIS_and_RS) and helps them develop knowledge and skills that they will use throughout their careers.

## Course Objectives
- To teach students how to work with geogarphic web services.
- To introduce students to modern data science methods and tools that can be used to augment their research in geography and remote sensing.
- Encourage students to use web services, webmaps, and webapps for visualizing and contextualizing data.
