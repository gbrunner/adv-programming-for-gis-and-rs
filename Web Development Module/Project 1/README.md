# Project 1 - Create 3 web applications from the similar (if not the same) datasets!

## Goal: I want you to create three web applications: one with Leaflet, one that uses the 2D map view with the ArcGIS Javascript API, and one that uses a 3D scene or globe view with the ArcGIS Javascript API.
## Due: March 9th at Midnight.
## Score: Out of 150 points. Anything exceeding 150 points is a A+!

## The Assignment: 
I would like you to find at least 2 datasets that are 
somewhat complementary and create a Leaflet app, an ArcGIS Javascript 
API 2D app, and a Javascript API 3D scene app for each using 
essentially the same data.  If you can't use the same data in 
each app, I'd like the features to be similar in theme. 
I want you to create the same app multiple times so you 
can see the similarities and differences between these 
JavaScript mapping frameworks. While I want you to use 
the same or similar data for each map, you may find that 
using GeoJSON format might be an easier way to use data 
in Leaflet while a Webmap or Feature Service might be 
an easier approach using the ArcGIS Javascript API. 

## Requirements:
Each application must have:
- At least 2 layers, not including the basemap. You can use 
different basemaps in your Leaflet and ArcGIS Javascript 
API apps. **10 points app**
- Use some combination of point, line, and polygon features. 
I don't just want to see all points! **10 points per app**
- Your layers should each contain at least 10 features. 
**10 points per app**
- When your code is done, share the apps on Github as live, 
interactive maps. **10 points per app**
- Include a popup on at least one layer. **10 points per app**
- **Bonus** Add a widget (legend, search, layer list, etc.) 
or button to one of the apps! **10 points**

## Miscellaneous
1. For this project, I don't want to be the first person you come to 
with questions. You can talk to your classmate. That being said, 
I am hoping to see variation in the data and maps that are submitted. 
**Submit *your* own work**
2. If you are unclear about the instructions, 
let me know as soon as possible!
3. **I hope to see some beautiful maps!!!**

## Presentation
I plan to hold class remotely on March 10th via Zoom and 
have each student present his or her applications during class. 
Be prepared to talk about your maps and apps on March 10.
